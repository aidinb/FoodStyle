# Aidin Challenge

## Description

This project is a mobile application built with React Native that displays countries in a hierarchical manner, starting from higher levels. It utilizes various libraries and tools to manage state, make API calls, handle navigation, and render SVG files.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: Framework for building native apps using React.
- **Axios**: For making API calls to fetch data.
- **MobX**: For state management, providing the following advantages:
   - **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and use, especially for developers familiar with object-oriented programming.
   - **Performance**: Efficiently tracks and updates only the parts of the state that have changed.
   - **Scalability**: Suitable for large applications due to its flexible and modular architecture.
- **React Native SVGs**: For rendering SVG files within the app.
- **React Navigation**: For handling navigation between different screens and levels.
